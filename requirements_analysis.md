# Solar Lead Generation System - Requirements Analysis

## Lead Qualification Criteria
1. **Property Type**
   - Owner-occupied single-family homes only
   - Exclude rental properties, multi-family units, and commercial buildings

   - Minimal shading from trees or other structures
   - Suitable roof type and condition

4. **Exclusion Criteria**
   - Properties with existing solar installations
   - Properties with recent solar permits
   - Properties with significant structural issues
