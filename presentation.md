# Solar Lead Generation System
## Identifying Qualified Solar Leads in Texas

---

## Overview

The Solar Lead Generation System is a comprehensive platform designed to identify and qualify homeowners in Texas who would benefit most from solar energy installations. The system combines property data, utility information, roof characteristics, and homeowner details to score and prioritize potential leads.

---

## Business Challenge

- Solar companies need to efficiently identify qualified prospects
- Traditional lead generation methods are inefficient and costly
- Identifying the right homeowners is critical for conversion success
- Need to prioritize homes with higher estimated power bills
- Must focus on properties with suitable roof characteristics

---

## Solution: Targeted Lead Generation

Our system identifies qualified leads based on:

- **Owner-occupied single-family homes**
- **Estimated electric bills exceeding $120/month**
- **Suitable roof characteristics (orientation, size, condition)**
- **No existing solar permits**
- **Available contact information through skip tracing**

---

## Key Features

1. **Skip Tracing + Data Enrichment**
   - Fills in missing contact information
   - Enriches property data with relevant characteristics

2. **Net Metering Heat Map**
   - Visual representation of areas with highest energy costs
   - Identifies neighborhoods with greatest solar potential

3. **Comprehensive Lead Scoring**
   - Multi-factor evaluation of lead quality
   - Prioritizes leads most likely to convert

---

## Data Sources

- **Property Tax Records**: Owner information, property characteristics
- **Utility Rate Data**: TDU rates, fee trends by region
- **Zillow / MLS API**: Roof type, square footage, property details
- **Google Maps API**: Roof orientation and solar potential
- **Skip Tracing Services**: Contact information enrichment

## Lead Scoring Algorithm

Our proprietary scoring algorithm evaluates leads based on:

- **Bill Size (30%)**: Higher bills = greater savings potential
- **Roof Suitability (25%)**: Orientation, size, shading, condition
- **Property Value (15%)**: Value, type, ownership status
- **Net Metering Benefits (20%)**: Utility policies and rates
- **Homeowner Profile (10%)**: Contact info, ownership length

---

## Score Categories

- **Excellent (80-100)**: Highly qualified leads with optimal conditions
- **Good (65-79)**: Strong candidates with favorable conditions
- **Average (50-64)**: Potential candidates needing further evaluation
- **Poor (35-49)**: Less favorable candidates with limitations
- **Unsuitable (<35)**: Not recommended for solar installation
